The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive, user-friendly study platform for students taking 
the NYS Math Regent Examination. Designed specifically for English language learners, the website 
aims to equip students with the necessary tools and resources to excel in subjects like Algebra 1 and 
beyond. By providing dedicated problem sets by teachers, practice exams, and performance tracking 
to help students and teachers monitor their progress and identify areas where they need to focus their 
efforts, we aim to empower students to reach their full potential and achieve proficiency in these 
important exams.
